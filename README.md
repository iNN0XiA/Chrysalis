# How to build

###### Chrysalis is made with discord.js v14, so you will need Node.js 16.9 or higher to run it.

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. Install MongoDB on your server.
4. Make a copy of `.env_sample`, put your database details and your Discord token in it and rename it to `.env`.
5. Follow the instructions on `src/emojis.js` to make custom emojis work.
6. Start the bot using `npm run dev` (for development) or `npm start` (for production).
